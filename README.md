# Gambling-Game-Project
This is a console based game about gambling... because I have no project ideas
This is just meant to be a small project so I can learn how to program because I'm pretty bad at it 
lmao
also make sure that when you download it you also create a bin folder and vs code should do the rest, if you don't use vs code then I have no idea what to do
the bin folder is only for building the program in vs code if you really want to but I'll make a release soon
The program only works on windows... I think, again I don't know.

Also feel free to tell me how I am an idiot and fix my stupidity so I can learn from it

P.S 
I'm gonna say that this project is complete! yay! of course it has some bugs and things that I would like to do but can't, I will come back to this later in life when i'm more experienced but for now it's time to move on. 

Thanks internet!
