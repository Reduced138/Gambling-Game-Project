# Gambling-Game-Project
This is a console based game about gambling... because I have no project ideas
This is just meant to be a small project so I can learn how to program because I'm pretty bad at it 
lmao
also make sure that when you download it you also create a bin folder and vs code should do the rest, if you don't use vs code then I have no idea what to do
the bin folder is only for building the program
